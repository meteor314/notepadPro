Notepad Pro is a free (as in “free speech” and also as in “free beer”) source code editor and Notepad replacement that supports several languages. Running in the Linux environment, its use is governed by GPL License.

Based on the powerful editing component Qt, Notepad Pro is written in C++. By optimizing as many routines as possible without losing user friendliness, Notepad Pro is trying to reduce the world carbon dioxide emissions. When using less CPU power, the PC can throttle down and reduce power consumption, resulting in a greener environment.
